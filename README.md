# census

At my current client we needed an application to keep track of the traffic of some external services that we host. The idea was to build statistics based on the access logs of the apache tomcat servers. 

There are tons of applications that can do this but I also wanted a nice topic to learn myself Spring Boot and new client side technologies like webpack, vuejs etc. 

And so Census was born.
